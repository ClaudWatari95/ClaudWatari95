### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a fullstack developer with fluency in JavaScript (Node/Express, ReactJs and Angular, with testing in Mocha/Chai), Python (Django), Version control (GIT) and Continous Integration (Travis CI)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP (Laravel with Homestead), C++, Dart/Flutter and general algorithms
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fullstack projects

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to programming, especially JavaScript
- ðŸ“« Follow me on <a href = "https://twitter.com/ClaudWatari">Twitter</a>, <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/claudwatari/">Instagram</a> and <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/watari-claud-kamau/">LinkedIn</a>

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love music as much as I love programming (Rock, Classical and Orchestra, Hip Hop, Old RnB, a little Pop and maybe some reggae as well). Looking to get to music production later.
