### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a fullstack developer with fluency in JavaScript (Node/Express, ReactJs and Angular, with testing in Mocha/Chai), Python (Django), Version control (GIT) and Continous Integration (Travis CI)
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning PHP (Laravel with Homestead), C++, Dart/Flutter and general algorithms.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fullstack projects. Currently leading 2 different teams of developers, and a member in a third, showcasing my leadership skills at the Google Africa Developer Scholarship, while also mentoring learners. A member of both the Facebook Developer Circles and Google Developer Groups where I offer technical mentorship to fellow members.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to programming, especially JavaScript, will debug your code for free if you're not delegating everything to me ie, collaborative assistance.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love music as much as I love programming (Rock, Classical and Orchestra, Hip Hop, Old RnB, a little Pop and maybe some reggae as well). Looking to get to music production later.
